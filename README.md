# Bank Loan Report

I'm thrilled to share a glimpse into my latest project, Bank Loan Analysis, which I've undertaken with great enthusiasm! ðŸ’¼
(While sparked by a YouTube video but the DAX formulas unveiled here shine as a testament to my individual flair and expertise)

Crafted three bespoke dashboards, each unveiling unique problem statements necessitating tailored solutions to tackle precise business challenges

# Summary-Dashboard:
1. Total Loan Applications - We need to tally the total number of loan applications received within a specified period. Additionally, it's important to keep an eye on Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications and monitor changes Month-over-Month (MoM).

2. Total Funded Amount - Gaining insight into the total amount of funds disbursed as loans is pivotal. Additionally, we aim to monitor the Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Funded Amount and analyze the Month-over-Month (MoM) changes in this metric.

3. Total Amount Received - Monitoring the total amount received from borrowers is imperative for evaluating the bank's cash flow and loan repayment dynamics. It's crucial to analyze the Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Amount Received and observe the Month-over-Month (MoM) fluctuations.

4. Average Interest Rate - Deriving the average interest rate across all loans and tracking Month-to-Date (MTD) variations provides valuable insights into our lending portfolio's cost dynamics. Additionally, monitoring Month-over-Month (MoM) changes in interest rates enhances our understanding of portfolio performance.

5. Average DTI (Debt-to-Income) - Assessing the average Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio for our borrowers is instrumental in understanding their financial well-being. It's imperative to calculate the average DTI for all loans, monitor Month-to-Date (MTD) trends, and track Month-over-Month (MoM) fluctuations for comprehensive insights.

It offers a comprehensive breakdown of key metrics essential for a nuanced understanding of loan performance. Delving into granular details, this dashboard meticulously presents data points including ID, purpose, home ownership status, loan grade, subgrade, issue date, funded amount, interest rate, installment amount, and received payment amount. By providing this detailed insight, the 'Details Dashboard' empowers stakeholders to make informed decisions and optimize loan strategies with precision
